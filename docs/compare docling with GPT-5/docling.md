Fig. 10.4.3.2 Death cap Amanita phalloides.

This image presents a detailed collection of mushrooms, likely from the *Amanita* genus, arranged on a wooden surface for identification. It showcases various developmental stages, from small button forms to mature specimens. Key features for identification are clearly visible: pale to olive-brown caps, white stems with a distinct skirt-like ring (annulus), and a prominent cup-like volva at the base. One mushroom is cut longitudinally, revealing its internal structure, including the gills. Several caps are also shown from the underside. A 1 cm scale bar provides a size reference, emphasizing the importance of careful observation for differentiating potentially deadly species.

reduction of the hepatic uptake of amatoxin. In some cases, liver transplantation may be the ultimate way of saving the patient.

## 1B-  Early primary nephrotoxicity (aminohexadienoic acid poisoning)

Allenic norleucine (aminohexadienoic acid) and chlorocrotylglycine in Amanita smithiana, A. pseudoporphyria, A. proxima , and some

Fig. 10.4.3.3 Destroying angel Amanita virosa.

This image displays five fresh, light-colored mushrooms laid out horizontally on a wooden surface. The fungi exhibit pale, ranging from white to yellowish-green, caps and stems. Key morphological features are prominently visible: a membranous ring (annulus) on the upper part of the stem and a distinct, often bulbous or sack-like volva at the base of each stem. One mushroom is longitudinally sliced, revealing its internal structure. A "1 cm" scale bar provides a size reference. The detailed presentation of these features, particularly the prominent volva and annulus, strongly indicates these are species from the *Amanita* genus, which includes many highly poisonous varieties like the Death Cap.

other Amanita species can cause acute kidney injury (AKI). Initial gastrointestinal and other symptoms develop between 20 minutes and 12 h after ingestion, followed by AKI a few days later. This was reported from North America after ingestion of A. smithiana , mistaken for Tricholoma magnivelare ,  and in southern France, in patients who had eaten A. proxima ,  mistaken for A. ovoidea as  part o f 'proximien syndrome' . 'Proximien syndrome' consists of gastrointestinal symptoms starting 8-  14 h after ingestion, followed after 4 days by AKI with evidence of transient liver damage and severe cardiotoxicity in some cases.

## 1C-  Late primary nephrotoxicity (orellanine poisoning)

Orellanine  is  a  potent  nephrotoxin  present  in  certain  species  of the  family  Cortinariaceae,  genus Cortinarius.  C.  orellanus and C.  rubellus ( speciosissimus )  ('cortinar'  or  webcap')  ( Figs.  10.4.3.4 and 10.4.3.5 ) are responsible for most poisonings. Orellanine is a bipyridine N-  oxide that may interfere with protein synthesis in the kidneys causing interstitial nephritis, tubular cell damage, basal cell membrane rupture and, eventually, irreversible fibrosis.

## Clinical features

Orellanine poisoning is the most insidious of all mushroom poisonings. Occasionally, there may be some mild gastrointestinal symptoms within a couple of days after the meal, but as these symptoms

Cortinarius rubellus (speciosissimus).

This image showcases multiple specimens of a mushroom species laid out on a weathered wooden surface. The fungi feature distinct orange-brown caps, varying from conical to broadly convex, and lighter yellowish-tan stems, some with visible fibrous bases. One cap is inverted, revealing prominent, radially arranged gills matching the cap's color. Green moss and roots are attached to some bases, hinting at their natural environment. A 1cm scale bar is present, providing an accurate size reference. This collection offers a detailed morphological study, highlighting the characteristic shapes and structures of the species.
