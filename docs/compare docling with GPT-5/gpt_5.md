## 1B — Early Primary Nephrotoxicity

*(Aminohexadienoic Acid Poisoning)*

**Allenic norleucine (aminohexadienoic acid)** and **chlorocrotylglycine**, found in *Amanita smithiana*, *A. pseudoporphyria*, *A. proxima*, and some other *Amanita* species, can cause **acute kidney injury (AKI)**.

### Symptoms and Progression

* **Onset:** 20 minutes–12 hours after ingestion
* **Later Effects:** AKI develops after a few days
* **Reported Cases:**

  * *A. smithiana* ingestion in North America (mistaken for *Tricholoma magnivelare*)
  * *A. proxima* ingestion in southern France (mistaken for *A. ovoidea*) — termed **“Proximien syndrome”**

**Proximien syndrome** includes:

* Gastrointestinal symptoms (after 8–14 hours)
* AKI (after 4 days)
* Transient liver damage
* Severe cardiotoxicity (in some cases)

## 1C — Late Primary Nephrotoxicity

*(Orellanine Poisoning)*

**Orellanine** is a **potent nephrotoxin** found in certain *Cortinarius* species (family *Cortinariaceae*).
Major culprits:

* *C. orellanus*
* *C. rubellus* (*speciosissimus*)
  Also known as “**cortinar**” or “**webcap**”.

### Mechanism

Orellanine, a **bipyridine N-oxide**, interferes with protein synthesis in the kidneys, leading to:

* Interstitial nephritis
* Tubular cell damage
* Basal cell membrane rupture
* Irreversible fibrosis

### Clinical Features

Orellanine poisoning is **insidious**—mild gastrointestinal symptoms may appear after a couple of days but are often overlooked before kidney damage manifests.

## Figures

### **Fig. 10.4.3.2 — Death Cap (*Amanita phalloides*)**

**Description (≈60 words):**
A large, pale green or yellowish mushroom with white gills and a prominent volva at the stem base. It’s one of the most **lethal mushrooms**, responsible for most fatal poisonings worldwide due to **amatoxin**. Found in forests near oak or pine. Even small amounts can cause **irreversible liver damage**.

---

### **Fig. 10.4.3.3 — Destroying Angel (*Amanita virosa*)**

**Description (≈70 words):**
A pure white mushroom with a smooth cap, slender stem, and bulbous base enclosed by a volva. It contains **amatoxins** similar to *A. phalloides* and is equally deadly. It grows in wooded and grassy areas across Europe. Symptoms of poisoning mimic gastrointestinal illness but progress to **liver and kidney failure**.

---

### **Fig. 10.4.3.4 — *Cortinarius rubellus* (*speciosissimus*)**

**Description (≈80 words):**
A reddish-brown mushroom with a fibrous cap and web-like veil remnants (cortina). It contains **orellanine**, a delayed-action nephrotoxin causing irreversible **kidney failure** days after ingestion. Found in moist coniferous forests. Because of its pleasant appearance, it’s often mistaken for edible species, leading to severe poisoning cases in Europe.
